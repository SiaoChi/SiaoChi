# Hi there! üëã  This is Kelly's repo!

Passionate about coding, I believe in creating tools that empower people to reuse and benefit from them significantly.

## Goals üéØ

My ultimate objective is to be an independent backend engineer, crafting awe-inspiring programs that people admire.

## Recent Experience üöÄ
- On board for a new position as a backend developer in Nov 2023.
- Completed the AppWorks School bootcamp for backend programming during Apr-Aug 2023.
- Through self-learning on online tutorial websites, I developed a recipe website using Python and Django, equipped with CRUD functionality in 2022.

## Latest Side Project üå±

I recently developed a social networking website called "YOUR FRIENDS ‰Ω†ÁöÑÊô∫Âèã" dedicated to helping caregivers of dementia patients. This platform facilitates connections, allowing them to make new friends and share experiences.

## Favorite Creations üíª

One of my favorite projects is an application leveraging LINE's webhook to create a simple app. This chatbot assists users in sending messages to a chatroom and automatically archives them in Google Sheets. Moreover, it enables users to search for relevant information using specific keywords. The chatbot called "Âá±ËéâÁöÑÂ≠∏ÁøíÁ≠ÜË®ò".
