# Hi there! 👋

I'm a former marketing professional who made a career transition to become a backend engineer. Passionate about coding, I believe in creating tools that empower people to reuse and benefit from them significantly.

## Goals 🎯

My ultimate objective is to be an independent backend engineer, crafting awe-inspiring programs that people admire.

## Recent Experience 🚀

- Completed the AppWorks School bootcamp for backend programming during Apr-Aug 2023.

## Latest Project 🌱

I recently developed a social networking website dedicated to helping caregivers of dementia patients. This platform facilitates connections, allowing them to make new friends and share experiences.

## Favorite Creations 💻

One of my favorite projects is an application leveraging LINE's webhook to create a simple app. This chatbot assists users in sending messages to a chatroom and automatically archives them in Google Sheets. Moreover, it enables users to search for relevant information using specific keywords. The chatbot called "凱莉的學習筆記".

I'm thrilled to meet you all and eager to learn from your valuable insights and expertise. Feel free to connect and collaborate!🙋‍♀️
